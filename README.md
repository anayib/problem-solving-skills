# Problem solving process

This repo aims to explain a clear process for algorithm problem solving.

It is addressed to programming students who are new to problem solving or experienced software developers who want to strengthen their problem solving skills following a clear and effective process.

This process is created by Nayib Abdala after trying different approaches and studying from several years the best ways to learn how to solve problems.

**PACER** - Problem Algorithm Code Execution Refactor - 

## Problem
- Define the problem in your own words
- Identify expected **input** and **output**. Also define the data structure to transform the input into the output. 
- Make the **requirements** explicit
- Identify **rules**

  ### Examples
  - Analise some examples/test cases
  - Analise the potential edge cases

  ### Data Structure
  - Define the **input data** and the expected **output data** (outcome)
  - How we **represent data** that we will work with when **converting the input to output**.
  
  ### Rules
  - Understand the restrictions and requirements of the problem. 

## Algorithm
- Describe the step by step to transform the input into the output in any case you have been given to test
- What are the algorithm	steps for converting input to output

## Code
Translate the algorithm into any programming language of your preference.

## Execute
Execute the algorithm to test it.

## Refactor
Refactor the code to improve its performance.
